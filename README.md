# Presentation of the study

In the PDF presentation you will find a quick display how the dataset, what are its interest and purpose, what we have done and also our results !

# Notebook

This is the notebook where all our tests, functions, results where calculated.
Normaly, it was redacted to be easy to read and quite understandable aswell. Enjoy your reading.

Watch out and don't run the GridSearchCV ;)

Thanks to a Boosting model with tuned hyper parameters, we've managed to reach an accuracy score of 0.839 !

# API

Our API is a replica from of the survey. You will have 14 questions to answer and our model will give you your weight level ! (from insufficent weight to obesity lvl 3)
